# Coding Test KMART Melbourne

## Objective
- Translate a problem into a working solution
- Demonstrate clear understanding of C# .NET.
- Communicate solution using clean code that is easy to read/understand
- Demonstrate ability to unit test code
- Provide clear instructions on how to verify solution

### Stretch goals
- Continuous integration of solution using Github actions 
- Solution containerisation using Docker
- Code linting
- Code coverage reporting

## Get Started
Please keep committing to this GitHub repository as you develop your solution.  Your solution is expected to be implemented in C# .NET.  Please do not commit the company name in any of the documentation or code. 

When you are done, share the repository URL with the person who asked you to try this exercise.

## Problem
Develop a function that takes one string input of any number of integers separated by single whitespace. The function then outputs the longest increasing subsequence (increased by any number) present in that sequence. If more than 1 sequence exists with the longest length, output the earliest one. You may develop supporting functions as many as you find reasonable.
